## Introduction

I think before we talk about Modus or Hypermode, we need to talk about what problems this platform is helping us solve.

According their github repository:

> Modus: an open source, serverless framework for building model-native apps, powered by WebAssembly

Now, a brief look at their github repository examples and their documentation, you might notice they are doing somethings differently from the rest of the backend frameworks:

- WebAssembly. Where most of backend frameworks use Nodejs, Go, Pythone and Rust amongst others, Modus uses WebAssembly. I think this is a unique choice and dare I say smart as we will dive a bit deeper into this choice and its benefits.

- Model-native apps. This is a term I had to think about a bit, could not find an "official" definition. But, I think it borrows, although not the same thing, the spirit of `Cloud-native apps`. Both represent some sort of evolution of in software architecture. Cloud-native apps helped us with how we build and deploy software by deeply integrating cloud principles. Model-native apps aim to do the same by embedding AI/ML models as foundational components in develpoing intellegent APIs.

The question remains whether Modus truly brings about about paradigm shift in software architecture. Modus, withstanding the fact that it is a relatively new project, I personally am curiously excited to follow them and see whether a broader adoption of WebAssembly and AI/ML models will have a long term impact on its adoption.

Can they bring about a paradigm shift? Will it gain the adoption needed for it to truly bring a paradigm shift? It can be argued that its uniqueness lies in combining no new ideas but rather re-uisng existing ones in a new way.

My opinion, as Modus stands right now, is that they can at least bring about a paradigm-enabling concept, if they haven't already, `the model-native approach`, treating AI/ML models as foundational, first class components in developing intelligent APIs.

## Why Modus?

- What is Hypermode?
- What is Modus?
- Boilerplate abstraction

### Intelligent API, what does that mean?

### GraphQL-first API

### Under the hood

#### Go GraphQL tools

- WunderGraph

#### AssemblyScript?

- Bad stuff about AssemblyScript
- Good stuff about AssemblyScript
  - Modus does not use it for the Web Browser
  - Type safety
  - Performance
  - WebAssembly
  -

#### Building blocks

- Modus is a microservice architecture
-

#### Architecture
